# Source Autotex

A QtPy5 app that uses Nem's VTFCmd to create vtf files automatically.

## Usage

Put the executable found in the **release** tab and add a folder named `bin`where you will need to download and add the x64 VTFCmd and it's dlls

Once that's done, run the app and a folder named `mats` should appear. This is where you want to put you texture files

On the program, select the file format, specify a name and convert. 

The pbr checkbox is for textures generated by fennecai's blender pbr to source method.
